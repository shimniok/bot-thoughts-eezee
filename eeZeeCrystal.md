One board, one easy crystal & two caps make one clean Arduino breadboard project!

# Introduction #

This tiny board is a crystal and matched caps cleans up your breadboard Arduino and ATmega projects. No extra wires, one part instead of three.

If you breadboard as many Arduino projects as I do you get a little tired of fiddly caps and crystals that don't fit right and fall out if you look at them funny. I have a set of these on hand for myself. Maybe you'll find them handy.

# Details #

The eeZee Crystal has a tiny surface mount 16MHz crystal with two surface mount capacitors and pin header.

Just line up the X1, X2, and GND pins on your ATmega with the labeled pins on the eeZee Crystal and plug it in your breadboard and you're good to go.
