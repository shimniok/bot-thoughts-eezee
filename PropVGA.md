# Introduction #

Your Propeller can generate VGA output with some software from the OBEX and this kit: a board, a few resistors, and a 15-pin connector.

All you have to do is solder on the components and add a ground wire or pin.

Designed especially for breadboard experiments with the eeZee Propeller breakout board but it will work with many other configurations, too.

# Assembly Instructions #

Use a flux pen, my preference, or flux paste. Regularly clean your soldering iron tip. I find that brass wool tip cleaners work best. Use a 0.022" or 0.032" solder, ideally, but whatever you have.

  1. Insert VGA connector onto the board
  1. Solder the large side pins onto the board
  1. Solder each of the 15 pins onto the board next
  1. Insert resistors according to markings and solder
    * Yellow, purple, brown, silver/gold = 470 ohm
    * Red, yellow, brown, silver/gold = 240 ohm
  1. Snip off leftover resistor leads with wire cutters
  1. Insert and solder the pin header
    * The most flexible configuration is to use a wire for ground.
    * You could populate one ground pin if it makes breadboarding more convenient
    * Of course you can also install wires in all the pin pads.
  1. Insert a wire for ground if necessary/desired
  1. Clean board with appropriate solvent. I usually use mineral spirits
